%  Repeated-measures ANOVA assumes that error is purely random.
%  A random factor that causes a measurement in one subject
%  to be a higher (or lower) should have no affect on the next
%  measurement in the same subject. This assumption is called
%  circularity or sphericity. Sphericity, is therefore a measure
%  of equality of variances of the differences between treatment
%  levels.
%
%  The adjusted degrees of freedom is returned to correct the p-
%  value obtained from the treatment F statistic:
%
%  padj = 1-fcdf(F,DFn,DFd)
%
%  y is a vector of the data
%  subj is a vector of subject identifiers
%  gp is the number of treatment groups
%  alg is the algorithm used (see below)
%  DFn is the degrees of freedom in the numerator
%  DFd is the degrees of freedom in the numerator
%
%  y values must be ordered appropriately for each subject
%
%  The algorithms include:
%  1) Greenhouse-Geisser (GG)
%     - for 1-way repeated-measures ANOVA (conservative)
%  2) Huynh-Feldt-Lecoutre correction (HFL)
%     - for 1-way repeated-measures ANOVA (less conservative)
%     - for correcting violations of multisample sphericity in
%       repeated-measures designs with >=2 independent groups
%
%  The default is 'HFL', corresponding to the Lecoutre corrected form of
%  the Huynh-Feldt adjustment [3]. The alternative is 'GG' for the
%  Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment.
